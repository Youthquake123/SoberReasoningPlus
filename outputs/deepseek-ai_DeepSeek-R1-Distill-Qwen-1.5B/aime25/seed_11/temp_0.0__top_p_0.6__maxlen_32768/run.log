We did not manage to extract a prediction in the correct format. Gold: ['821'], Pred: ["Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nWe have twelve letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L. These letters are randomly grouped into six pairs. Each pair is placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form a two-letter word. Then, these six words are listed alphabetically. The question is asking for the probability that the last word in this list contains the letter G. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then I need to find m + n.\n\nAlright, so let's break this down. First, we're dealing with twelve letters, which are split into six pairs. Each pair is ordered alphabetically, so for example, if we have letters C and A, the word would be AC. Then, all these words are arranged in alphabetical order, and we need to find the probability that the last word in this sorted list contains G.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the key here is that the last word is the largest possible word in the list. Since the words are sorted alphabetically, the last word is the one that comes last when all the words are arranged from A to Z.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the probability that G is the last letter in the largest word. Wait, no, actually, the last word is the one that comes last in the alphabetical order, which is the word with the highest letters. So, the last word is the one that is the largest possible, which would be the word that starts with the highest possible letters.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you sort words alphabetically, the order is determined by the first letter, then the second letter, and so on. So, the first word in the sorted list is the one that starts with the first letter of the alphabet, and so on.\n\nBut in this case, we have six two-letter words, each formed by a pair of letters. So, each word is two letters, and the entire set of words is six two-letter words. When we sort them alphabetically, the order is determined by the first letter, then the second letter.\n\nSo, the first word in the sorted list is the one that starts with the earliest letter, and the last word is the one that starts with the latest letter. But wait, no, that's not necessarily true because the second letters can affect the order as well.\n\nWait, let me think. For example, if we have two words: AB and AC. Then, AB comes before AC because B comes before C. Similarly, if we have AB and BA, then AB comes before BA because A comes before B. So, the order is determined first by the first letter, then by the second letter.\n\nTherefore, the first word in the sorted list is the one with the earliest first letter, and if there are multiple words starting with the same first letter, then the one with the earliest second letter comes first. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters determine the order.\n\nSo, in our case, since we have six two-letter words, each formed by a pair of letters, the first word in the sorted list is the one with the earliest first letter, and the last word is the one with the latest first letter.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the first letters could be the same, so the order is determined by the second letters. So, if all the first letters are the same, then the order is determined by the second letters. If the first letters are different, the one with the earlier first letter comes first.\n\nTherefore, the last word in the sorted list is the one with the latest first letter. So, the last word is the one that starts with the latest possible letter.\n\nBut in our case, the letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L. So, the latest possible first letter is L. But wait, we have only six two-letter words, each using two distinct letters. So, the first letters can be any of the letters, but each letter can only be used once.\n\nWait, no, actually, each letter is used exactly once in the pairs. So, each letter is part of exactly one pair. So, the first letters of the six words can be any six distinct letters from the twelve, but since we have only six two-letter words, each letter is used exactly once.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each letter is part of exactly one pair, so each letter is used exactly once in the entire set of six words. So, the first letters of the six words are six distinct letters, each from A to L, but not necessarily consecutive.\n\nWait, but the letters are being paired randomly. So, the first letters of the six words are six distinct letters, each from A to L, but each letter is used exactly once. So, the first letters can be any six distinct letters, but they can be in any order.\n\nWait, but the letters are being paired randomly, so the first letters of the six words are six distinct letters, each from A to L, but each letter is used exactly once. So, the first letters can be any six distinct letters, but they can be in any order.\n\nWait, but the letters are being paired randomly, so the first letters of the six words are six distinct letters, each from A to L, but each letter is used exactly once. So, the first letters can be any six distinct letters, but they can be in any order.\n\nWait, but the letters are being paired randomly, so the first letters of the six words are six distinct letters, each from A to L, but each letter is used exactly once.
